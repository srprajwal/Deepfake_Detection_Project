  <!-- Introduction -->

  <!-- Detection Approach -->
  <h2 class="text-dark mt-4">Our Approach</h2>
  <p class="text-justify text-black">
    We presented a neural network-based approach to classify the video as deep fake or real, along with the confidence
    of the proposed model. The proposed method is inspired by the way deep fakes are created by GANs with the help of
    Autoencoders. Our method performs frame-level detection using ResNext CNN and video classification using RNN along
    with LSTM. This enables us to analyze both spatial and temporal features effectively. The proposed method is capable
    of detecting the video as a deep fake or real based on the listed parameters in our paper. We believe that it will
    provide very high accuracy on real-time data.

  <!-- Importance of Deepfake Detection -->
  <h2 class="text-dark mt-4">Why Deepfake Detection Matters</h2>
  <p class="text-justify text-black">
    Deepfake technology has evolved rapidly, enabling the creation of hyper-realistic fake videos that are nearly
    indistinguishable from reality. These videos have been used for various malicious purposes, such as misinformation
    campaigns, identity theft, and even fraud. Detecting deepfakes is essential for maintaining trust in digital
    content, ensuring cybersecurity, and protecting individuals from being misrepresented or defamed.

  <!-- Advanced Techniques -->
  <h2 class="text-dark mt-4">Advanced Techniques in Detection</h2>
  <p class="text-justify text-black">
    Our system incorporates cutting-edge technologies such as transfer learning and attention mechanisms to enhance
    detection accuracy. By leveraging pre-trained models like ResNet and fine-tuning them for deepfake-specific tasks,
    we achieve high precision in identifying subtle artifacts left by manipulation tools. Additionally, our use of LSTM
    layers for temporal analysis ensures robust detection for even highly dynamic videos.

  <!-- Future of Deepfake Detection -->
  <h2 class="text-dark mt-4">The Future of Deepfake Detection</h2>
  <p class="text-justify text-black">
    As deepfake generation methods become more sophisticated, detection algorithms must evolve to stay ahead. The future
    of deepfake detection lies in integrating AI-powered tools into accessible platforms, enabling real-time analysis of
    videos uploaded on social media and other platforms. Collaborative efforts between AI researchers, governments, and
    tech companies will play a critical role in combating this emerging threat.
